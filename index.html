  { title: "I BLEW IT ALL", category: "Originals", text:
`i don‚Äôt know what to say now,  
i don‚Äôt know where to start,  
i don‚Äôt know how it happened  
and i don‚Äôt know which way to go.  

i tell myself it‚Äôs okay  
that i made the right decision;  
yet i don‚Äôt want to go alone,  
but it was my decision.  

even if i walked away  
and believed in my doubts,  
there‚Äôs nothing i can do,  
i can only say, i blew it all.  

i pray he‚Äôd be waiting when i get home,  
i need someone to ease the pain,  
i hope his love still remains,  
but i know, i blew it all.` },

  { title: "UNFAITHFUL", category: "Originals", text:
`not knowing a single joy in marriage,  
warmth and love for me was a mirage.  
then came the dawn and my heart dejected,  
it was more than i could take, i didn‚Äôt wait.  

i walked away to ease the sorrow,  
he was no boy, not yet a man;  
at first it was just talking, nothing more,  
then hands and touches wrote their plan.  

the body listened when the soul would fight,  
pleasure came and turned the page.  
shame then rose and woke the truth,  
the hollow echo of the stage.  

i learned the cost of fleeting flame,  
that body‚Äôs song can break the heart;  
i sought the love that filled the soul,  
and repented from the start.` },

  { title: "GUILT", category: "Originals", text:
`i willed for him to sing like poets do,  
to craft a verse that felt like truth.  
he was a man of quiet ways,  
actions speaking more than proof.  

i closed the gate when longing grew,  
and wandered into reckless games.  
i loved in bodies, hollowed out,  
left empty rooms and borrowed names.  

those choices left a darkened pall,  
a weight that settled like a shroud.  
i wear the scar of what i did,  
and whisper sorry to the crowd.  

now in the silence i have learned  
the quiet song of steady love;  
his simple presence, patient and kind,  
was all my restless heart had dreamed of.` },

  { title: "I PUT THE BLAME ON YOU", category: "Originals", text:
`sorry i can‚Äôt say sorry for the things i did,  
you were gone and working through the night.  
duty stole the hours of our days,  
and left my heart to search for light.  

i knelt at times and begged and prayed,  
wished you home to hold me close.  
i blamed the absence for my wrongs,  
yet pain belongs to those who chose.  

the empty bed, the lonely room,  
the nights you spent away from me.  
but when the truth came crashing in,  
i owned the fault, i set you free.  

for blame is easy, truth is hard,  
i bear the weight of what i‚Äôve done.  
let anger fall where it may lie,  
my lesson learned beneath the sun.` },

  { title: "INNOCENT TIMES", category: "Originals", text:
`they were days i‚Äôll never see again,  
i took for granted youthful wind.  
mischief, laughter, careless nights,  
the small rebellions of our time.  

evening walks and endless songs,  
danced until the break of day.  
innocence held a brighter light,  
we didn't know to be afraid.  

we fought with mothers, ran away,  
we thought the world would never end.  
but tender years demanded growth,  
and lessons came to shape and mend.  

those innocent, unguarded days  
are held like treasure in my chest;  
they taught me love, they taught me loss,  
and led me onward to what‚Äôs best.` },

  { title: "STRUGGLE", category: "Long Journey", text:
`shadows weighed heavy on weary days,  
dreams felt lost inside a maze.  
each step forward met a stone,  
and every breath was choked and lone.  

yet through the cracks a light would start,  
soft healing warming my tired heart.  
i rose again from bitter ground,  
found steadiness in shifting sound.  

the darkest hours shaped my song,  
gave patience where i once was wrong.  
from brokenness a truth was born,  
i learned to stand despite the storm.  

now i walk with head held high,  
beneath the vast and steady sky.  
struggle carved a road of gold,  
and taught me strength from tales untold.` },

  { title: "STRENGTH", category: "Long Journey", text:
`storms once shattered every shore,  
they taught me lessons deep and raw.  
the winds would howl; the seas would pound,  
yet slowly strength within was found.  

each wound a lesson, each scar a flame,  
no two days of suffering the same.  
i stitched my courage from the night,  
and kept a stubborn, steady light.  

from broken paths i built my way,  
to softer nights and brighter days.  
the pounding pain refined my core,  
i found the strength to seek for more.  

my heart now beats with steady song,  
a rhythm learned from right and wrong.  
strength was born when trials bend,  
and courage grew beyond the end.` },

  { title: "LONELINESS", category: "Long Journey", text:
`cold nights whispered that i was alone,  
the silence echoed through my bones.  
i walked the rooms and faced the doubt,  
i listened to the quiet shout.  

in solitude a mirror rose,  
revealing what my spirit knows.  
the stillness called me to a plan,  
to learn the truth of who i am.  

though solitude felt like a chain,  
it taught me how to walk again.  
i found in silence honest grace,  
a truer self within that space.  

now loneliness is not a snare,  
it‚Äôs breathing room, a time to care.  
the quiet gives my heart the key  
to open up and simply be.` },

  { title: "HOPE", category: "Long Journey", text:
`i walked through fire, i walked through rain,  
i learned to hold despite the pain.  
a small bright ember in my chest  
refused to yield to grief‚Äôs unrest.  

it whispered, ‚Äúbreathe, the night will pass,‚Äù  
and taught my heart to lift at last.  
the dawn arrived on gentle wings,  
and hope unrolled its healing springs.  

no storm can choke that steady light,  
no endless dark can hide its might.  
it grows with every step i take,  
a gentle glow through every ache.  

so when the night returns again,  
i‚Äôll listen to that quiet friend.  
hope is the anchor standing near,  
the soft assurance that draws me clear.` },

  { title: "FREEDOM", category: "Long Journey", text:
`life once felt like heavy chains,  
my voice acquainted with refrains.  
i learned to carry falseness long,  
to walk a path that felt all wrong.  

then courage came to split the dark,  
and light returned a tiny spark.  
i shed the masks i used to wear,  
took deeper breaths of honest air.  

freedom is not escape or flight,  
but peace within the quiet night.  
it is the truth that sets the tone,  
the knowing that i am my own.  

so now i walk with open skies,  
no pretense left, no needless ties.  
my spirit sings a softer tune,  
my life is mine beneath the moon.` },

  { title: "RESILIENCE", category: "Long Journey", text:
`in the deep dark i learned to see,  
a quiet strength that lived in me.  
each failure built a stepping stone,  
a pathway etched from bone to bone.  

broken once, i found repair,  
new shoots rising from despair.  
the heat of trials tempered steel,  
showed all the ways my heart could heal.  

resilience taught me how to rise,  
to greet the dawn with open eyes.  
i hold the scars like maps of grace,  
proof that i survived the race.  

when future storms come roaring near,  
i‚Äôll meet them with a voice sincere.  
resilience moves through every test,  
a constant friend that helps me rest.` },

  { title: "REBIRTH", category: "Long Journey", text:
`valleys cold and wastelands wide,  
i walked with ash on every side.  
then softly life began to stir,  
a whispering that called to her.  

roots that slept beneath the snow  
broke and pushed the green to show.  
from shattered roots new shoots arose,  
a tender song the morning chose.  

rebirth is rising from the fall,  
a second chance to re-enroll.  
the past remains but does not bind,  
a lesson cradled in the mind.  

so now i stand with newfound breath,  
renewed by all that once was death.  
my spirit blooms in colors new,  
and carries hope in morning dew.` },

  { title: "HEALING", category: "Long Journey", text:
`tears once carved a river wide,  
i thought the hurt would never hide.  
but gentle time and patient hands  
began to knit up fractured lands.  

healing came with quiet pace,  
a softness growing in its place.  
each scar a map of roads i passed,  
a chapter closed that could not last.  

the pain remains but does not bind,  
it taught me truths that now i find.  
a softer heart, a wiser eye,  
a calm that helps me reach the sky.  

so now i smile through what was pain,  
i‚Äôve gained a gentler self again.  
healing is the art of time,  
a steady song, a slower rhyme.` },

  { title: "TRUST", category: "Long Journey", text:
`hard roads once bent my soul to dust,  
yet slowly i reclaimed my trust.  
i learned that wounds can teach the way,  
and tender hearts can choose to stay.  

trust is not blind, it looks and weighs,  
it opens slow through honest ways.  
it mends the cracks that time reveals,  
and lets the fragile spirit heal.  

when given gently, trust will grow,  
like tendrils curling toward the glow.  
it builds the bridges time may break,  
and holds the love for both our sakes.  

so now i live with faith anew,  
believing love will see me through.  
trust lights the path from night to day,  
and guides the weary on their way.` },

  { title: "JOY", category: "Long Journey", text:
`yesterday‚Äôs sorrow shaped my song,  
a melody that carries on.  
i learned to bend and learned to sing,  
to find the joy in simple things.  

joy is not shallow, fleeting play,  
it grows from tears we faced each day.  
it warms the rooms that once were cold,  
a light that sobers yet consoles.  

every laugh that cracks my chest  
is proof that sorrow met its rest.  
i dance between the dusk and dawn,  
and hold the peace that‚Äôs gently drawn.  

so let me sing and let me dance,  
to give my restless heart a chance.  
joy born from trials stays and thrives,  
and anchors love in all our lives.` },

  { title: "COURAGE", category: "Healing & Growth", text:
`my legs would shake, my voice was small,  
the fear had built an inner wall.  
but courage whispered, soft and low,  
"you have the strength you need to grow."  

i took a step though knees would quake,  
i stood despite my heart‚Äôs own break.  
with every try, the fear grew thin,  
and courage learned to hold me in.  

it‚Äôs not the absence of the fright,  
but walking on into the night.  
the trembling hand that still extends  
is bravery that never ends.  

so when the dark comes calling near,  
i‚Äôll face it gently, without fear.  
courage will be my quiet friend,  
and lead me to a better end.` },

  { title: "FAITH", category: "Healing & Growth", text:
`when clouds obscured the clear blue sky,  
and doubts would whisper, "why, oh why?",  
faith reached down and held my hand,  
and guided me to steadier land.  

it is the trust when sight is dim,  
a steady, patient, quiet hymn.  
it keeps the heart from falling fast,  
and plants belief to hope at last.  

in waking hours and in sleep,  
faith keeps the promises i keep.  
it speaks of grace in simple voice,  
and offers every soul a choice.  

so with my heart i walk each day,  
and let my faith light up the way.  
it is the anchor in my chest,  
the gentle voice that calls me blessed.` },

  { title: "PERSEVERANCE", category: "Healing & Growth", text:
`the uphill road was full of stones,  
my feet were worn and tired of moans.  
but perseverance kept me near,  
a steady hum that quelled my fear.  

i rose each time i fell before,  
and patched the wounds to climb once more.  
small steps collected into miles,  
and layered slowly into styles.  

perseverance is the patient art  
that stitches hope back to the heart.  
it does not promise easy roads,  
but carries with it lighter loads.  

so i will keep my forward pace,  
no matter how the winds may race.  
perseverance will be the drum  
that tells my weaker self to come.` },

  { title: "GRATITUDE", category: "Healing & Growth", text:
`a single breath, a morning small,  
could change the way i felt it all.  
gratitude paints the world anew,  
it turns the grey to tender hue.  

i count the gifts i thought were small,  
the quiet smile, the whispered call.  
each softened moment builds a song,  
that makes my weary heart belong.  

it‚Äôs not the riches, nor the fame,  
but simple things that stake a claim.  
a cup of tea, a friend‚Äôs kind ear,  
a hand to hold when nights are near.  

so i will thank the sky and ground,  
for tiny mercies scattered round.  
gratitude keeps my soul awake,  
and heals the long and heavy ache.` },

  /* === Pack 2: Poems 26‚Äì50 === */
  { title: "PATIENCE", category: "Healing & Growth", text:
`time once mocked my eager feet,  
as i rushed ahead in quick defeat.  
but patience whispered, "wait and see,  
the best will come when it should be."  

it taught me stillness, taught me rest,  
to trust that life will give its best.  
though silence stretched and minutes long,  
patience hummed a steady song.  

the waiting grew my roots so deep,  
a soil where trust and hope could keep.  
the blossom came, so pure, so true,  
a gift of time that love once grew.  

so now i wait with gentler hands,  
accepting what my heart commands.  
patience is the tender art,  
that teaches calmness to the heart.` },

  { title: "KINDNESS", category: "Healing & Growth", text:
`a gentle word, a softened tone,  
can heal a heart that feels alone.  
a simple smile, a hand to share,  
can show another that we care.  

kindness costs us not a thing,  
yet blooms like flowers in the spring.  
it lifts the spirit, warms the day,  
and guides the weary on their way.  

small acts can shift the darkest skies,  
can wipe the tears from heavy eyes.  
it is the balm the world still needs,  
a garden grown from gentle seeds.  

so let me live with kindness clear,  
to spread some light while i am here.  
for kindness, though it seems so small,  
is love that heals and saves us all.` },

  { title: "FORGIVENESS", category: "Healing & Growth", text:
`the wound was deep, the pain was real,  
i thought my heart would never heal.  
but forgiveness whispered soft and low,  
"release the weight, just let it go."  

it is not saying wrong was right,  
nor dimming truth or hiding sight.  
it is the gift i give to me,  
to set my weary spirit free.  

the anger chained, the grudge would bind,  
but letting go released my mind.  
forgiveness opened up the door,  
to live in peace forevermore.  

so now i walk with lighter heart,  
a brand new chance, a gentler start.  
forgiveness is the grace i give,  
that teaches me how best to live.` },

  { title: "BALANCE", category: "Healing & Growth", text:
`i worked too hard, i pushed too long,  
i thought my worth was only strong.  
but balance whispered, "take a rest,  
a calmer mind will serve you best."  

i learned to pause, to breathe, to stay,  
to give myself both night and day.  
the scales of life must gently hold,  
not just the work but joys untold.  

when balance keeps its steady ground,  
a peaceful rhythm can be found.  
it makes the heart both light and true,  
and shows the soul what it can do.  

so now i walk with even stride,  
not lost in work, nor swept by tide.  
for balance keeps my spirit near,  
and whispers truth for me to hear.` },

  { title: "PEACE", category: "Healing & Growth", text:
`the world was loud, the noise was near,  
it filled my chest with doubt and fear.  
but peace arrived on gentle streams,  
and softened chaos into dreams.  

it did not shout, it did not fight,  
but wrapped me warm through darkest night.  
a quiet voice that hummed inside,  
a place where anxious thoughts could hide.  

peace is the song of steady seas,  
the gentle sway of autumn trees.  
it lives in silence, lives in breath,  
and calms the soul from fear of death.  

so now i seek it every day,  
in prayer, in love, in simple way.  
peace is the friend who walks me home,  
a steady guide where‚Äôer i roam.` },

  { title: "LOVE", category: "Healing & Growth", text:
`i searched for love in fleeting flame,  
in passing looks and whispered name.  
but love is not a shallow spark,  
it is the torch that lights the dark.  

it stays when storms have swept the sky,  
it lifts the soul when teardrops dry.  
it chooses daily, soft and true,  
to give its best in all we do.  

love is the root that holds the tree,  
the song that sets the spirit free.  
it is the hand that pulls us near,  
the tender voice that calms our fear.  

so let me love with all my might,  
in morning glow and darkest night.  
for love is all, the purest art,  
the endless song within the heart.` },

  { title: "UNITY", category: "Healing & Growth", text:
`alone we falter, lose our way,  
together we can face the day.  
each hand extended makes us strong,  
a woven thread where all belong.  

unity is the bridge we build,  
the common ground where hearts are stilled.  
it binds the weak, uplifts the small,  
and teaches love to conquer all.  

though different paths may shape our stride,  
the goal of peace is still our guide.  
together strong, we rise above,  
a chorus loud with human love.  

so let me stand with hand in hand,  
to heal the hurt across the land.  
unity shines, a light so true,  
a world reborn when hearts renew.` },

  { title: "WISDOM", category: "Healing & Growth", text:
`i once believed i knew it all,  
but folly built my rise and fall.  
through trial, error, loss, and pain,  
i learned what truly would remain.  

wisdom came not quick nor fast,  
but lessons carved from moments past.  
the scars became the teacher‚Äôs mark,  
a lantern glowing in the dark.  

it taught me when to hold, to wait,  
when to forgive, when not to hate.  
it gave me eyes that see more clear,  
a listening heart that holds more dear.  

so now i seek not fleeting fame,  
but truths that light a steady flame.  
for wisdom is the crown we earn,  
from every path we walk and learn.` },

  { title: "SERVICE", category: "Healing & Growth", text:
`i found no joy in hoarded gold,  
in selfish gain, in stories told.  
but service opened wide the door,  
to riches deep forevermore.  

to give a hand, to share my bread,  
to comfort one who weeps in bed.  
these acts of love, though small, though few,  
return a joy forever new.  

service is not the loss of me,  
but finding more of what i‚Äôll be.  
in lifting others, i arise,  
and see the world with kinder eyes.  

so let me serve with willing heart,  
and play in life a healing part.  
for service writes the truest song,  
that lifts the world and makes us strong.` },

  { title: "HONESTY", category: "Healing & Growth", text:
`lies once tangled, thick and wild,  
they broke the heart of trusting child.

that even cold can help us grow.

the tender gift of eternal spring.  

so when life feels too cold, too long,  
remember spring will sing its song.  
eternal cycles, tried and true,  
will bring the light and life to you.` },
